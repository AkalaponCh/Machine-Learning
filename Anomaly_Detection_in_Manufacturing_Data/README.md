# ** About Dataset **

The Manufacturing Process Dataset contains 10,000 rows of time-stamped observations collected at one-minute intervals from an industrial machine. It includes seven key features: Temperature (Â°C), Machine Speed (RPM), Production Quality Score, Vibration Level (mm/s), Energy Consumption (kWh), and a binary flag for Optimal Conditions. This dataset provides a rich ground for exploring applications in predictive maintenance, quality assurance, energy optimization, and anomaly detection within a smart manufacturing context. Users can leverage it for machine learning tasks such as classification (predicting whether conditions are optimal), regression (forecasting quality scores or energy usage), and clustering (identifying operational patterns). With real-world relevance to Industry 4.0, IoT, and digital twin systems, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to improve manufacturing efficiency and product quality through data-driven insights.
